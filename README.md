# SharePoint.AngularJs.App
SharePoint hosted app with CRUD operations using AngularJs

I have made a small POC on how to use Angular JS in SharePoint Apps (SharePoint hosted).

This app performs all the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on SharePoint list.

My attempt is to help out all the new SharePoint and Angular developer and developer community working out.

Please help out in improving the code, all your comments and feedbacks are valuable to me.
